# SMSNodejs

This is a single page app coded in Node.js on May 2016 using the Twilio API.  The github repository was erased but is now restored here for future reference.  There were also bugs in the code that were copied from the original desktop hard drive source.  That is, although the static page is rendered, the SMS function is not properly executed.  A working version is found on 'textNodejs.'
